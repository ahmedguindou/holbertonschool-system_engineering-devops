# 1. Distributed Web Infrastructure

## üåê Scenario

A user wants to access `www.foobar.com`. In this setup, the infrastructure uses three servers to ensure better reliability, scalability, and performance.

## üß± Components Breakdown

### ‚ûï Additional Elements and Why

| Component     | Reason                                                                 |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Load Balancer (HAProxy)** | Distributes traffic between servers to avoid overloading one machine. |
| **Two Web Servers**         | Improves redundancy and allows parallel handling of user requests. |
| **Primary-Replica DB**      | Supports data redundancy and load sharing in reads. |

## üîÑ Load Balancer

- **Tool**: HAProxy
- **Algorithm**: *Round Robin*
  - Distributes requests in a circular sequence: Server 1, Server 2, Server 1, etc.
- **Setup**: *Active-Active*
  - Both servers are actively handling requests at the same time.
  - **Active-Active vs. Active-Passive**:
    - **Active-Active**: All servers handle traffic simultaneously.
    - **Active-Passive**: One server handles traffic, the other waits to take over if the first fails.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Primary-Replica Database

### How it works:
- The **Primary** database (on Server 1) handles all **write** operations.
- The **Replica** (on Server 2) receives synchronized **read-only** copies of the data.
- Replication is usually **asynchronous**, so there's a slight delay.

### From the App‚Äôs Perspective:
- **Writes** ‚Üí go to the **Primary**
- **Reads** ‚Üí can be handled by either the **Primary** or **Replica** to improve speed and load distribution.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Infrastructure Issues

| Issue Type    | Explanation                                                                 |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SPOF**       | The Load Balancer itself is a Single Point of Failure (SPOF) unless replicated. |
| **Security**   | No firewall, no HTTPS ‚Üí vulnerable to attacks and data leakage.            |
| **Monitoring** | No monitoring tools ‚Üí no alerts or diagnostics for system failures.        |
